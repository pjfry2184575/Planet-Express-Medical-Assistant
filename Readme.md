Planet Express Medical Assistant.user.js

Description

This script's main use is for reviving. Presenting its user a mechanism to filter out people in the faction view.

Currently, the script allows to filter based on:

Idle

Offline

Time in hospital threshold (default 1h)

Alternatively, a couple of extra modifications are made to allow easier access to the members list, especially useful in mobile devices:

Members list is moved just below the faction information block

Wars/Walls are hidden

Faction Description is hidden

All of the above can be configured to your own preferences. For this, the script also adds a new element above the members list with checkboxes to control what is hidden or not. These options are persistent, meaning that you should not have to re-set them every time you load the page.

Lastly, two extra features were added to the script to make it easier to revive:

When loading a player profile, if that user has revives turned off, the script will record the user id and hide it from the faction view for the next 5 minutes

A Refresh button is present on the Filter Controls box. This button is a shortcut to refresh the webpage.

Known Issues

Persistency does not seem to work on mobile, so the filtering options and players with revives off features will not work on
